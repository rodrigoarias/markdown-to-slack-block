# markdown-to-slack-block

A simple action that attemps to transform an input in markdown format to something compatible with an [Slack Block](https://api.slack.com/block-kit)

This action was created for a very specific purpuse so it supports only a few markdown elements.

## Inputs

## `markdown`

**Required** A string in markdown format.

## Outputs

## `slack-blocks`

A string as an Slack Blocks object.

## Example usage

Something like this:
```
## v 0.1.2
### üöÄ Features
  - Some cool feature [PR-51](https://github.com)
  ### üêõ Bugs
  - This is for real [PR-49](https://github.com)
  - Fixing the cool feature [PR-50](https://github.com)
  - Fixing the fix of the feature [PR-60](https://github.com)
```

Its transformed into this:
```
{"blocks":[{"type":"section","text":{"type":"mrkdwn","text":"*v 0.1.2*","verbatim":true}},{"type":"divider"},{"type":"section","text":{"type":"mrkdwn","text":"*üöÄ Features*","verbatim":true}},{"type":"section","text":{"type":"mrkdwn","text":"- Some cool feature  <https://github.com|PR-51>\n","verbatim":true}},{"type":"section","text":{"type":"mrkdwn","text":"*üêõ Bugs*","verbatim":true}},{"type":"section","text":{"type":"mrkdwn","text":"- This is for real  <https://github.com|PR-49>\n- Fixing the cool feature  <https://github.com|PR-50>\n- Fixing the fix of the feature  <https://github.com|PR-60>\n\n","verbatim":true}}]}
```
